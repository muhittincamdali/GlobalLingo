## Migration Guides

### Migrating from 0.9.0 to 1.0.0

#### Breaking Changes
- Updated translation engine API
- Changed voice recognition interface
- Modified language detection method

#### Migration Steps
1. **Update Translation Calls**
   ```swift
   // Old API
   let result = translationEngine.translate(text: "Hello", to: "Spanish")
   
   // New API
   let result = try await translationEngine.translate(
       text: "Hello",
       from: .english,
       to: .spanish
   )
   ```

2. **Update Voice Recognition**
   ```swift
   // Old API
   let speech = voiceRecognition.recognize(audioData)
   
   // New API
   let speech = try await voiceRecognition.recognizeSpeech(audioData)
   ```

3. **Update Language Detection**
   ```swift
   // Old API
   let language = translationEngine.detect(text: "Bonjour")
   
   // New API
   let language = try await translationEngine.detectLanguage(text: "Bonjour")
   ```

### Migrating from 0.8.0 to 0.9.0

#### Breaking Changes
- Updated service initialization
- Changed error handling approach

#### Migration Steps
1. **Update Service Initialization**
   ```swift
   // Old API
   let service = TranslationService()
   
   // New API
   let service = TranslationService(networkService: networkService)
   ```

2. **Update Error Handling**
   ```swift
   // Old API
   do {
       let result = service.translate(text: "Hello")
   } catch {
       // Handle error
   }
   
   // New API
   do {
       let result = try await service.translate(text: "Hello")
