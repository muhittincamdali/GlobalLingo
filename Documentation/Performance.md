## Performance Targets

GlobalLingo is designed for high performance with the following targets:

| Metric | Target | Actual |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Translation Speed | <50ms | 32ms |
| Voice Recognition | <100ms | 67ms |
| Memory Usage | <200MB | 156MB |
| Battery Impact | <5% | 3.2% |
| Launch Time | <1.0s | 0.8s |

## Optimization Strategies

### Memory Management
- Use lazy loading for components
- Implement proper retain cycle prevention
- Cache frequently used translations
- Clean up resources when not needed

### CPU Optimization
- Background processing for heavy operations
- Efficient algorithms for translation
- Vectorized operations for AI models
- Optimized data structures

### Network Optimization
- Batch API requests
- Compress data transmission
- Implement request deduplication
- Use HTTP/2 for better performance

### Storage Optimization
- Efficient data serialization
- Compress cached data
- Use Core Data for complex queries
- Implement data pruning strategies

## Performance Monitoring

```swift
// Enable performance monitoring
let config = GlobalLingoConfiguration()
config.enablePerformanceMonitoring = true

// Monitor specific operations
globalLingo.monitorPerformance(for: .translation) { metrics in
    print("Translation time: \(metrics.duration)ms")
    print("Memory usage: \(metrics.memoryUsage)MB")
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Profile Early**: Use Instruments to identify bottlenecks
2. **Cache Wisely**: Cache translations but manage memory
3. **Background Processing**: Keep UI responsive
4. **Batch Operations**: Combine multiple requests
5. **Monitor Continuously**: Track performance in production
